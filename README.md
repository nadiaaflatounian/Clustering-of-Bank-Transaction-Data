# Clustering Bank Transaction Data

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook, `Clustering-Bank-transaction data.ipynb`, demonstrates how to perform clustering on bank transaction data. The goal is to identify patterns and group similar transactions together, which can be useful for various applications such as fraud detection, customer segmentation, and transaction categorization.

## Contents

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading and inspecting the dataset.
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling and transformation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing the data to understand distributions and relationships.
   - Identifying key features for clustering.

3. **Clustering Techniques**:
   - Applying different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.
   - Evaluating the performance of the clustering models using appropriate metrics.

4. **Cluster Analysis**:
   - Analyzing the characteristics of the clusters formed.
   - Visualizing the clusters to interpret the results.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`
